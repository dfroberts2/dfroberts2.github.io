        <a name="10_5"></a><h2>October 5, 2015</h2>
        <p>This week I looked into an issue that has been bothering internet users for years: SPAM! We're all familiar with spam, it is bothersome emails that contain information we do not care to see. Often spam messages contain advertisements, scams and sometimes viruses. With the number of internet users at such a massive volume, more and more people are falling victim to spam.</p>
        <p>Since there are many different types of spam, I chose to look at the type that seems to cause the most harm and that's those that contain malware or link to malware.</p>
        <p>Spam emails can contain executable, downloadable files that may be enticing to download. Or there may be links in emails that download files to a users computer. If the user opens these files, they can risk infection for their computer. Sometimes emails can appear to contain completely blank messages, but the html of the email actually contains instructions to download unwanted files. These bad emails sometimes may appear to be from other users you know. When this is the case, infected users (especially AOL users) have had their email address hijacked and the malicious message isn't even from them. This makes it harder to tell that the message is spam.</p>
        <p>Spam is tough to combat globally because there is no accepted definition of spam and it is difficult to enforce cyber crimes. The best way to combat the detrimental effects of spam is to educate yourself on the types of spam and recognize what they look like. Only download files if you know exactly what it is and if it is the exact file that you requested. It is also good to be aware of what the expected file size should be so you know if you are downloading the right file.</p>

        <h2><a name="10_4"></a>October 4, 2015</h2>
        <p>Wow! What a week. We've started to dive into the thick of using computer logic. We started using the language Ruby to design tiny programs. Ruby is a neat little language with many intuitive features that make beginning programming easy. This post will talk about two objects used in Ruby: Arrays and Hashes. It is getting late, so I will keep it brief while addressing the important aspects of both of these objects.</p>
        <h3>Arrays</h3>
         <p>Now both arrays and hashes are what we call <i>container</i> objects. This means that contained within the object is a collection of many objects. The difference between hashes and arrays is how they store their objects. Each object within an array has an index value associated with it. See the example below:</p>

      <section class="blog_img 10_4_15_img_1">
       <img src = "../imgs/10_4_15_img_1.png">
       <p class="img_text">Array</p>
      </section>

      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>This is an example of the Ruby language. Only pay attention to the text right of the ">" In line 1, we defined the array "a". It is defined as an array because of the [] brackets. Inside array a, we added elements "a" "b" "c" and "d". Line 2 shows this as the output. As I said before, array elements have an associated index value. These values correspond to the order of the elements, from left to right, starting with a value of 0. So this means that the 0th element in array a is "a". While the 1st element of array a is "b" and so on. Examples of this are shown in lines 3-6. The last element of the array can be accessed with a negative index value. This is why the -1st element of array a is a "d"</p>
        <p>Arrays have a variety of uses. They are good when the order of the objects in the array matters. This makes the index valuable useful. Arrays are also good for having objects that are all the same type. For example, if you wanted to look up the ID numbers of a marathon winners that were contained in a large array, you could use the index value to search this.</p>
        <h3>Hashes</h3>
        <p>Hashes are similar to arrays, but keeping track of the objects contained in the hash is a bit different. Hashes don't have a numerical index associated with the objects they contain. Instead each object in the has has an associated "key" that points to a value contained in the hash. See the example below:</p>

      <section class="blog_img 10_4_15_img_2">
       <img src = "../imgs/10_4_15_img_1.png">
       <p class="img_text">Hash</p>
      </section>
      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>The above shows how to define a hash in Ruby. In line 1, we defined "a" as a hash. It is defined as a hash because of {} brackets. Inside hash a, we defined 3 keys and 3 values. The keys are the full state names and they point to their associated value using the "=>" Their associated values are state abbreviations. In lines 3-7, we call their values using their key.</p>
        <p>The specificity of hashes can be useful. For example, a hash could be helpful when you are trying to standardized the submission of a form. So if someone enters an address and you want all the submissions to have state abbreviations you could have the keys of the hash be different submission possibilities and run the submissions through the hash. This is an example that the above hash could be useful.</p>

        <h2><a name="9_25"></a>September 25, 2015</h2>
        <p>Things have really been moving fast at DevBootcamp. That's the way I like it! After 3 weeks we've covered all of the basics of web page design. Last week we reviewed HTML formatting and organization. This past week, we started moving into new territory (for me) and covered CSS, a styling language that brings aesthetic appeal to wepbages.</p>
         <p>CSS has the power to change how content looks on a screen. This involves changing the font, size, and color of elements. However, it also involves changing the position of the elements on the page. In this post, I'll discuss a little more in depth how some of CSS positioning attributes work.</p>
         <p>In CSS there are 4 main ways to define an HTML element's (such as a paragraph, list, or header etc.). They are:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Static</li>
          <li>Relative</li>
          <li>Absolute</li>
          <li>Fixed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first position type, static positioning, might be the simplest to understand. It is the default way elements lie</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="blog_img 9_25_15_img_1">
       <img src = "../imgs/9_25_15_img_1.png">
       <p class="img_text">Static Positioning</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>In the image above, all of the HTML elemtents (each of the 4 divs) are positioned as static (even though the CSS is only shown for the 1st one). Since they are all written in the HTML as one after the other (Div 1 followed by Div 2, followed by Div 3, etc.), this is the way they are displayed. The only way to modify their position is by changing their margins and padding.</p>

        <p>The second position type, relative positioning, is like a more specific way of changing elements from their static positioning. Using the "top," "bottom," "left" and "right" properties, you can modify where the element lies <i>relative</i> to it's static positioning. See the below example:</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="blog_img 9_25_15_img_2">
        <img src = "../imgs/9_25_15_img_2.png">
        <p class="img_text">Relative Positioning</p>
      </section>


      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>In the example, Div 2 is shifted to the right. This is because the left property is set to 40px. This means that the left border starts 40 pixels from the where the left border would lie in the static position.</p>

        <p>The third position type, absolute positioning, can be modified in the same way as relative positioning, using the "top," "bottom," "left," and "right" properties. However, these change the element's position relative to it's parent elemtent. If it's parent element is the entire page body, it is relative to the </p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="blog_img 9_25_15_img_3">
        <img src = "../imgs/9_25_15_img_3.png">
        <p class="img_text">Absolute Positioning</p>
      </section>
      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>In the example above, the HTML was rewritten so Div 3 is contained within Div 2. This means that Div 2 is the parent element of Div 3. So the top border of Div 3 is 50 pixels from the top border of Div 2, and the left border of Div 3 is 70 pixels from the left border of Div 2.</p>

        <p>The last position type available in CSS is fixed. Fixed positioning simply locks an element in it's place on the screen. No matter where you scroll, the element will always appear in that same space on the screen. We'll need two screenshots to illustrate this:</p>
      </section>
      
      <section class="blog_img 9_25_15_img_4">
        <img src = "../imgs/9_25_15_img_4.png">
        <p class="img_text">Fixed Positioning.</p>
      </section>
  
      <section class="blog_img 9_25_15_img_5">
       <img src = "../imgs/9_25_15_img_5.png">
       <p class="img_text">Fixed Positioning.</p>
      </section>        

      <section class="blog_text">
        <p>If you note the scroll right scroll bar in the above screenshots, they are in different spots, yet Div 4 is in the exact same place in the viewing window. This is what fixed positioning does. You  can change where the element is fixed using the "top," "bottom," "left" and right properties.</p>
        <p>That is a intro to CSS positioning. Stay tuned for blog updates!</p>

      <h2><a name="9_11"></a>September 11, 2015</h2>
        <p>Week 1 got the ball rolling quickly and introduced a lot of new ideas and reviewed some ones I already had experience with.</p>
        <p>Week 1 introduced the command line. Using the command line, you can enter text called commands that can create, move, delete and execute files (among many other functions). From college, I already had some knowledge of these commands, but I had only performed these commands on a Unix system. This week taught me how to perform the same commands on a Windows machine (which I own). For the most part they are similar, but there are a few subtle differences.</p>
        <p>One of the big ideas introduced this week was the idea of "version control." Version control is the idea of monitoring changes to digital files. It keeps projects organized and aids the file creator(s) in moving back and forth between different file versions. From my days as a data analyst at Verzion, I was used to repeatedly saving and properly labeling files after modifications. But this week, DevBootcamp taught me a whole new, in-depth, way of performing version control using git and Github.</p>

    <p class="img_text">An example of version control flow, using a central remote repository like GitHub</p>
  </section>
  <section class="blog_text">
        <p>Git is a tool that helps you monitor changes you've made to files. As you change and create new files and folders, you can perform what is called "commit" to save these changes. You also can add notes that say the changes you've made. Using the git commands, you can check the status of the changes you've made, save the changes, and then send the changes to a remote location so that your changes can be accessed online. The most common resource where you can "push" your changes to is GitHub. GitHub is a great place to store your code because multiple users can access it. This aids in projects where there are many developers.</p>
