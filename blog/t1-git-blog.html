  <h1>Week 1</h1>
  <h2>An Intro to The Command Line, GitHub and Git</h2>
  <h4>September 11, 2015</h4>

      Week 1 got the ball rolling quickly and introduced a lot of new ideas and reviewed some ones I already had experience with.

        Week 1 introduced the command line. Using the command line, you can enter text called commands that can create, move, delete and execute files (among many other functions). From college, I already had some knowledge of these commands, but I had only performed these commands on a Unix system. This week taught me how to perform the same commands on a Windows machine (which I own). For the most part they are similar, but there are a few subtle differences.

        One of the big ideas introduced this week was the idea of "version control." Version control is the idea of monitoring changes to digital files. It keeps projects organized and aids the file creator(s) in moving back and forth between different file versions. From my days as a data analyst at Verzion, I was used to repeatedly saving and properly labeling files after modifications. But this week, DevBootcamp taught me a whole new, in-depth, way of performing version control using git and Github.

        Git is a tool that helps you monitor changes you've made to files. As you change and create new files and folders, you can perform what is called "commit" to save these changes. You also can add notes that say the changes you've made. Using the git commands, you can check the status of the changes you've made, save the changes, and then send the changes to a remote location so that your changes can be accessed online. The most common resource where you can "push" your changes to is GitHub. GitHub is a great place to store your code because multiple users can access it. This aids in projects where there are many developers.
