  How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  Wireframing worked with a partner worked out really good. On Mockingbird, we were both able to collaborate in real time on the same wireframe. This made the communication process extremely easy. We also used kobra.io to work on the html code at the same time.
  Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  I think wireframing is necessary when building a website. For me personally, I think it's easier to code something when you have a visual picture of what you want it to look like. This makes the organization of headers, footers, asides and sections very easy. It's hard when you're just looking at a blank page of code, even if you're basing it off of written instructions.
  What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
  A good wireframe makes a site attractive to the user, and easy to navigate.
  What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?
  We decided to use the aside element so that we could create a movable sidebar that would link to all of the blog posts. An aside is good in this instance, because it isn't a part of the main content on the page.
