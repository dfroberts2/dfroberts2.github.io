#3.5 CSS Website Reflection

##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders and margin by doing this challenge?
This challenge gave me good practice using the padding, borders and margin properties. Sometimes you want text to be spaced apart more or less, this is a good time to modify the margin or padding. Also, depending how elements are positioned, you may not be able to modify their margins or borders directly.


##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
CSS positioning is tricky at first. You have to think about how you want elements to move when you change the screen size and how they will interact with each other. It is very important to have good HTML container flow so that you can properly modify positioning.


##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The non CSS positioning modifications like text color, size and font are the easiest to implement. Positioning is by far the most difficult to get right


##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
Sometimes to modify a specific element you have to change your HTML so that you can target it properly. Additionally, you have to be careful that you aren't too general when choosing CSS selectors so that you don't change elements you don't wish to change
