            <p>Since the internet has so many resources on how to program, I thought the best kind of cheat sheet would organize those resources. This is a lot better than having me write code blocks of examples. Instead of googling ever single topic, I can refer to this page for a reminder on syntax or best-practices.</p>

        	<h3>Ruby</h3>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Array.html">Arrays</a></span>--Arrays are objects in Ruby that can contain multiple values. They are organized using indices, which are integers that describe the position of a value within the array. The Ruby Docs page here shows the types of methods that can be performed on arrays in Ruby.</p>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Hash.html">Hashes</a></span>--Hashses are objects in Ruby that also contain multiple values. However, they are organized differently than arrays. Instead of integer indices. They have values associated with keys that cannot be repeated. The Ruby Docs page here shows the types of methods that can be performed on hash objects in Ruby.</p>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/String.html">Strings</a></span>--Strings are objects that hold information as a specific order of characters.</p>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Enumerable.html">Enumerables</a></span>--The enumerable module provides methods that can operate on collection classes. These are objects that can hold multiple values such as arrays and hashes.</p>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/doc/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html">Control Expressions</a></span>--Control expressions are used to control how a program flows and how the value of different variables changes. The Ruby Docs here demonstrate the different types of controls that can be used in a Ruby program (such as while loops and if statements).</p>
        	<p><span class="topic"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.3/Class.html">Classes</a></span>--Classes are first-class objects. When you define a custome made class. You can define methods that apply specifically to that class. The also can have attributes that apply only to that class. The documentation here describes how to create a class.</p>
